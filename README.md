--A CV I built during my erasmus experience, this is not my official CV by any means. I am not a front-end developer, the creation of this project was to show:
  > An understanding of technialities for HTML/CSS 
  > Design and creativity
  > Problem solving
  > High interest to learn new things
  > Adaptability to arising problems
  > Overall contribution to my professional development as a software developer.


The contents of the CV will not be updated according to new qualifications/skills, as I mentioned It is not my official CV.
Any helpful feedback is always welcome.
